# Roslyn Analyzer Template

This repository provides a pure boilerplate template to make it easier to create a new analyzer project.

The analyzer project contained in this repository is based on the [project template in the Roslyn SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-sdk/tree/main/src/VisualStudio.Roslyn.SDK/Roslyn.SDK/ProjectTemplates/CSharp/Diagnostic).

The workflow contained in this repository is inspired by [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template).


## Getting started

All you have to do is click the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button.

After using the template to create your blank project, the Template Cleanup workflow will be triggered to override or remove any template-specific configurations, such as the project name, current changelog, etc.

For the last step, you have to manually modify the configuration in the YOUR_ANALYZER.Package/YOUR_ANALYZER.Package.csproj
